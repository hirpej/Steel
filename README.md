## üîç Overview of Hot Rolled Steel

Hot rolled steel refers to steel that has been rolled at very high temperatures (above 1700¬∞F), exceeding the recrystallization temperature for most types of steel. This process makes it easier to shape the steel, resulting in products with a wider variety of appearances.

A hot rolling steel company, due to market conditions, diverse sales, and high sales volume, requires dynamic and diverse reports. Generally, the production and sales process works as follows:
- Steel billets enter the system.
- They undergo rolling.
- Rolled sections are delivered to customers.

### Key Details:
- Customers place orders in bundles, but sales are based on tonnage.
- The cost is calculated per kilogram.
- Each bundle corresponds to a billet weighing 2 tons, though not fully utilized during production.
- Waste is the difference between the bundle weight and the sales tonnage.

### **Dimdate Table**

A helper table to convert Gregorian dates to Persian (Solar Hijri) dates and vice versa. It includes:
- Day, Month, Year
- Month name, Day of the week
- Week number of the year
- Covers years 1320 to 1429 in the Persian calendar.

## üöÄ Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Column Selection**:
   - Retain these columns in the final dataframe:
     `Transaction_ID`, `Export`, `Industry`, `City_Category`, `Payment`, `Customer_ID`, `Bandel`, `Real_Weight`, `Province`, `Industry_Cod`, `Waste`, `Year`, `Month`, `Type`, `Class`.

2. **New Columns**:
   - Add a column for `Waste`.
   - Convert `Bandel` to kilograms.

3. **Date Conversion**:
   - Add a `Miladi` column for Gregorian dates from `Save_Date_Time`.
   - Extract `Year` and `Month` from `Miladi`, then delete `Miladi`.

4. **Product_ID Split**:
   - Split `Product_ID` into `Type` and `Class` columns.

5. **Payment Scaling**:
   - Convert `Payment` from rials to billions of tomans.

## üìå Analytical Questions

1. **Yearly and Monthly Sales**:
   - Determine sales for imports and exports for each year and month.
   - Use `Year` and `Month` as dataframe indexes.

2. **Top Customers**:
   - Identify the top 10 customers by purchase volume, number of purchases, and total waste.
   - Sort by total sales in descending order.

3. **Industry Insights**:
   - Analyze sales, waste, and number of sales for each industry (`Machining`, `Welding`, `Construction`, `Riveting`, `Drawing`) by `Type` and `Class`.

4. **Province Analysis**:
   - Calculate total purchases, number of purchases, and total waste for each province per year.

5. **Product Form Analysis**:
   - Determine total kilograms produced for each `City_Category`, categorized by `Type` (straight vs. coil) and `Class`.

6. **Quartile Analysis**:
   - Categorize prices into `Low`, `Med`, and `High` based on quartiles (`Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`).
   - Add a `PriceLevel` column.

7. **Industry Filter**:
   - Filter data for industries with more than 50,000 sales and store in `Indfilter`.

8. **Waste Analysis**:
   - Report the average waste for the construction industry in 2020 for purchases with high prices, normalized by bundles.
